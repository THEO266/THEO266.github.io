                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
                    Hello, my name is Yuquan Yu, I am a Loyola University Chicago student who is currently taking Theology 266. Theology 266 is called “Church and Global Cultures” and focuses on how the Roman Catholic Church interacts with the rest of the world. Theology
                    266 is my service-learning course, and I am excited to learn and discuss topics that are not necessarily connected to my current studies. I have attached a photo and a small biography about myself :).

                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
                    I am currently majoring in marketing, so I am very interested in how the Catholic Church affects the world economically. One of the things that I find most interesting about marketing is how greatly people can be swayed by the things they already like.
                    Similar to how people flock to a product their favorite Instagram model has endorsed I am curious if similar behavior can be seen from members of the Catholic Church.

                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
                    I am an international student from Beijing, China. Catholicism is an unpopular religion in my home country, so I have not had many chances to study the Catholic Church or Christianity in general. I think that is the main reason why I was drawn to this
                    course.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Outside of the classroom I spend most of my free time playing soccer. I have played soccer since I was a little kid, and in my opinion, soccer is the ultimate sport. To play soccer all you need is a ball, making it the most inclusive competitive
                    sport in the world. I love playing soccer with my friends and I am always excited to watch the world cup every four years with my family. </p>
