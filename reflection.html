                    My Service Learning course emphasized a virtual encounter with disability culture and also the church's engagement with it. Here below are two reflections that I wrote throughout the course. They include things I have learned about my self and others,
                    about disability culture and the church’s engagement with it. I gained a deeper understanding of the relationship between the church and the disability culture by reading the class materials and connecting with my own experience. As
                    a matter of fact, I never thought about the connection between church and disability culture. What I learned in this course allowed me to explore a new point of humanistic concern.

                <h1>Service Reflection 1</h1>(Written on July 15)
                <p>When I heard about doing service-learning focused on disability I didn't know the experience was going to teach me about how hard life is of people with disabilities. Before this class, I have never had a real understanding of disability
                    culture, and I never had a serious awareness of people with disabilities in life frustration. Before reading the material from class, I used to think that people with disability are more prone to getting depressed, mainly because their
                    body poses some kind of challenge to them. However, I find that such thought is full of prejudice and ignorance. In fact, society's attitude towards people with disabilities is a major cause of their inconveniences.</p>
                <p>In the article called Disability, race/ethnicity and gender: themes of cultural oppression, acts of individual resistance by McDonald, Keys, and Balcazar (McDonald, Katherine E, Christopher B Keys, and Fabricio E Balcazar. "Disability,
                    Race/ Ethnicity, and Gender: Free from diverse diseases, Acts of Individual Resistance. "American Journal of Community Psychology 39.1 (2007): 145-161.), discussed human diversity and the interaction between the individual and society,
                    focusing on the issue of oppression. McDonald et al. mentioned in the article that although the proportion of adults with disabilities in the United States is not low, they are almost not represented in the community research, and
                    the lack of attention paid towards people with disabilities is very common (146). Reading this article made me understand that social oppression is widespread and that people with disabilities are being discriminated against and stigmatized
                    because they are different from "ordinary people."</p>
                <p>What impressed me most in the reading process was McDonald et al., referring to the exclusion of people with disabilities from community life, including community, school, employment, and leisure activities. Many people with disabilities
                    are ashamed of this (146). In my opinion, the church is a very important place for people with disabilities to feel the warmth of society. The church gathers people of the same faith, regardless of their status. People can find their
                    place in the religious community and feel the hope of God. A church should be a sanctuary for people with disabilities because keeping a caring heart is part of the teaching.</p>
                <p>With this kind of thought in mind, I realized the importance of learning disability culture and the church's engagement. The church should be an important part of promoting equality for all. The church's participation in helping disabled
                    people to go into the community can help people with disabilities feel the warmth from others and arouse the attention of society. People with disabilities should not be treated differently, and differences between people are more
                    easily overlooked because of shared beliefs in the church.</p>

                <h1>Service Reflection 2</h1>(Written on July 30)
                <p>After reading Encountering the Disabled God from Nancy Eiesland (Nancy Eiesland. “Encountering the Disabled God.” PMLA : Publications of the Modern Language Association of America 120.2 (2005): 584–586.), I have a deeper understanding
                    of the connection between disability culture and the church’s engagement. In fact, before reading this article, I have always believed that the church was more tolerant of people with disabilities because religion brings people hope
                    and care. However, the content of this article shocked me very much. Elesland notes that the Eucharist, which is supposed to be the ultimate sacrament of the union of believers, is a terrible and humiliating memorial for people with
                    disabilities (10). As the movement for the rights of people with disabilities continues to grow, how to make them enjoy equal treatment is an issue and a challenge that both church and the society is facing.
                </p>
                <p>Elesland shows that the main issue for the church is how to truly welcome people with disabilities, rather than encouraging their participation as a sound community voice without allowing people with disabilities to have their own voices
                    (10). People with disabilities experience no less discrimination and exclusion in the church than in other parts of society. In fact, the Bible itself explains the hazards, prejudice, hostility, and suspicion of people with disabilities.
                    This kind of situation seems to be a great challenge for the church. It is just to guarantee equal rights for people with disabilities, but the movement of accepting people with disabilities to get into the community is also relatively
                    contrary to the Bible. In the process of advancing the rights of people with disabilities, there are bound to be those who use the Bible as an excuse to obstruct the joining of people with disabilities, and how to break through this
                    prejudice is a question for believers to consider.</p>
                <p>In my opinion, a new ecclesiastical atmosphere needs to be established. As humanity advances, societies are bound to become more inclusive and diverse. People with disabilities deserve to feel equal and belonging to religious communities.
                    Such changes should not be mere propaganda and advocacy but should be substantive measures. First of all, as a group of people who share a common faith, it is necessary to pass on the idea that people should ignore other identity characteristics
                    and focus on their same purpose. Secondly, it is also important to increase the voice of people with disabilities in the church community, and their voices should be heard and taken seriously. Finally, increasing infrastructure for
                    people with disabilities in places of worship, such as churches, can also show concern for them.
                </p>
                <p>Religion is becoming more socially appropriate as times change. People with disabilities community, the gay community, and other groups have gained a more inclusive atmosphere after people's fight for equality. After reading this article,
                    I sincerely hope that people with disabilities can get more deeply involved in church activities and feel a friendly and joyful atmosphere. Although it is very difficult to change the status quo, I believe that with the efforts of
                    more people, people with disabilities will have a more equal position in the church and society as well.</p>
